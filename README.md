application up and running.

This is a simple Ruby on Rails application for creating and managing tasks. Users can create, edit, and delete tasks. Each task has a name, a description. Users can also upload and view multiple images to a task.

Summary of main functions of the application: 
- Creation: Users can create new tasks.
- Editing: Users can edit existing tasks, including editing name, description, and image.
- Deleting: Users can delete a task/tasks.
- Image Uploading: Users can upload one or more images when creating or editing a task.

The creation, editing and deleting function of this application are pretty self-explanatory. 
For uploading image(s), after clicking "New task" button and navigating to creation page, users can use the "Choose Files" button. Then there will be a pop-up window allows users to select one or more images from local folders, then submit the form to create a new task with the attached image(s).
